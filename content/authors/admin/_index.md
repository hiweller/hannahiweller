I want to know how to interpret organisms in the light of their evolutionary history. We often assume every trait on an organism is the direct product of natural selection, but this is almost never true. Drift and chance, at least in animals, seems to be the name of the game. So, which traits are adaptations, and which are byproducts? How often does evolution take the path of least resistance? And what does that mean, exactly, for the popular conception of evolution as an "optimizer"?

I find it helpful to think about every living thing as being like a very, very old house. Some of the parts are there because they've always been useful (walls), and some of the parts are new additions for new functions (solar panels); but a lot of parts are there because it was easier to modify what existed than it was to build something from scratch, especially if the house needs to be habitable the whole time. And, like houses, I think we can learn a lot about organisms by understanding them as the outcomes of their history.

Right now I'm studying the evolution of mouthbrooding (a kind of parental care where parents incubate offspring in their mouths), and how much feeding phenotypes influence that evolution. I think that mouthbrooding is a beautiful example of an extraordinary behavior (using a mouth as a nursery!) that arises from co-opting existing traits (some mouths are better nurseries than others, depending on how species feed).

I also work a lot on color pattern evolution, and have written a few R packages to make that easier for myself and others. Color is a very tricky trait: human beings are highly visual, and so we tend to ascribe a lot of importance to color pattern. To me, this is why it's so important to make sure that we're being careful and rigorous with the conclusions we draw about how much it matters to other living things. I think that accessible, objective tools for color pattern research are an important part of that. Plus, it turns out I just enjoy coding.
