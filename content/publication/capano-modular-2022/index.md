abstract: 'The evolution of constriction and of large prey ingestion within snakes
  are key innovations that may explain the remarkable diversity, distribution and
  ecological scope of this clade, relative to other elongate vertebrates. However,
  these behaviors may have simultaneously hindered lung ventilation such that early
  snakes may have had to circumvent these mechanical constraints before those behaviors
  could evolve. Here, we demonstrate that *Boa constrictor* can modulate which specific
  segments of ribs are used to ventilate the lung in response to physically hindered
  body wall motions. We show that the modular actuation of specific segments of ribs
  likely results from active recruitment or quiescence of derived accessory musculature.
  We hypothesize that constriction and large prey ingestion were unlikely to have
  evolved without modular lung ventilation because of their interference with lung
  ventilation, high metabolic demands and reliance on sustained lung convection. This
  study provides a new perspective on snake evolution and suggests that modular lung
  ventilation evolved during or prior to constriction and large prey ingestion, facilitating
  snakesâ€™ remarkable radiation relative to other elongate vertebrates.'
