abstract: 'Vertebrate dentitions are often collapsed into a few discrete categories,
  obscuring both potentially important functional differences between them and insight
  into their evolution. The terms homodonty and heterodonty typically conflate tooth
  morphology with tooth function, and require context-dependent subcategories to take
  on any specific meaning. Qualifiers like incipient, transient, or phylogenetic homodonty
  attempt to provide a more rigorous definition but instead highlight the difficulties
  in categorizing dentitions. To address these issues, we recently proposed a method
  for quantifying the function of dental batteries based on the estimated stress of
  each tooth (inferred using surface area) standardized for jaw out-lever (inferred
  using tooth position). This method reveals a homodonty-heterodonty functional continuum
  where small and large teeth work together to transmit forces to a prey item. Morphological
  homodonty or heterodonty refers to morphology, whereas functional homodonty or heterodonty
  refers to transmission of stress. In this study, we use *Halichoeres* wrasses to explore
  how functional continuum can be used in phylogenetic analyses by generating two
  continuous metrics from the functional homodontyheterodonty continuum. Here we show
  that functionally heterodont teeth have evolved at least three times in *Halichoeres*
  wrasses. There are more functionally heterodont teeth on upper jaws than on lower
  jaws, but functionally heterodont teeth on the lower jaws bear significantly more
  stress. These nuances, which have functional consequences, would be missed by binning
  entire dentitions into discrete categories. This analysis points out areas worth
  taking a closer look at from a mechanical and developmental point of view with respect
  to the distribution and type of heterodonty seen in different jaws and different
  areas of jaws. These data, on a small group of wrasses, suggest continuous dental
  variables can be a rich source of insight into the evolution of fish feeding mechanisms
  across a wider variety of species.'
