abstract: 'Teeth tell the tale of interactions between predator and prey. If a dental
  battery is made up of teeth that look similar, they are morphologically homodont,
  but if there is an unspecified amount of regional specialization in size or shape,
  they are morphologically heterodont. These are vague terms with no useful functional
  implication because morphological homodonty does not necessarily equal functional
  homodonty. Teeth that look the same may not function the same. Conical teeth are
  prevalent in fishes, superficially tasked with the simple job of puncture. There
  is a great deal of variation in the shape and placement of conical teeth. Anterior
  teeth may be larger than posterior ones, larger teeth may be surrounded by small
  ones, and patches of teeth may all have the same size and shape. Such variations
  suggest that conical dentitions might represent a single morphological solution
  for different functional problems. We are interested in the concept of homodonty
  and using the conical tooth as a model to differentiate between tooth shape and
  performance. We consider the stress that a tooth can exert on prey as stress is
  what causes damage. To create a statistical measure of functional homodonty, stress
  was calculated from measurements of surface area, position, and applied force. Functional
  homodonty is then defined as the degree to which teeth along the jaw all bear/exert
  similar stresses despite changes in shape. We find that morphologically heterodont
  teeth are often functionally homodont and that position is a better predictor of
  performance than shape. Furthermore, the arrangement of teeth affects their function,
  such that there is a functional advantage to having several smaller teeth surrounding
  a singular large tooth. We demonstrate that this arrangement of teeth is useful
  to grab, rather than tear, prey upon puncture, with the smaller teeth dissipating
  large stress forces around the larger tooth. We show that measurements of how shape
  affects stress distribution in response to loading give us a clearer picture of
  the evolution of conically shaped teeth.'
