abstract: 'Abstract Ultraviolet (UV) colour patterns invisible to humans are widespread
  in nature. However, research bias favouring species with conspicuous colours under
  sexual selection can limit our assessment of other ecological drivers of UV colour,
  like interactions between predators and prey. Here we demonstrate widespread UV
  colouration across Western Hemisphere snakes and find stronger support for a predator
  defence function than for reproduction. We find that UV colouration has evolved
  repeatedly in species with ecologies most sensitive to bird predation, with no sexual
  dichromatism at any life stage. By modelling visual systems of potential predators,
  we find that snake conspicuousness correlates with UV colouration and predator cone
  number, providing a plausible mechanism for selection. Our results suggest that
  UV reflectance should not be assumed absent in “cryptically coloured” animals, as
  signalling beyond human visual capacities may be a key outcome of species interactions
  in many taxa for which UV colour is likely underreported.'
