abstract: 'Locomotion in water and on land impose dramatically different
  demands, yet many animals successfully move in both environments. Most turtle species
  perform both aquatic and terrestrial locomotion but vary in how they use their limbs.
  Freshwater turtles use anteroposterior movements of the limbs during walking and
  swimming with contralateral fore‐ and hindlimbs moving in synchrony. In contrast,
  sea turtles swim primarily with “powerstroke” movements, characterized by synchronous
  forelimb motions while the hindlimbs act as rudders. High‐speed video has been used
  to study powerstroking, but pectoral girdle movements and long‐axis rotation (LAR)
  of the humerus are likely both key components to turtle locomotor function and cannot
  be quantified from external video. Here, we used XROMM to measure pectoral girdle
  and humeral movements in a sea turtle (loggerhead, *Caretta caretta*) compared to
  the freshwater river cooter (*Pseudemys concinna*) during terrestrial and aquatic
  locomotion. The largest difference among species was in yaw of the pectoral girdle
  during swimming, with loggerheads showing almost no yaw during powerstroking whereas
  pectoral girdle yaw in the cooter during rowing was over 30°. The magnitude of humeral
  LAR was greatest during loggerhead powerstroking and the temporal pattern of supination
  and pronation was opposite from that of cooters. We hypothesize that these kinematic
  differences are driven by differences in how the limbs are used to power propulsion.
  Rotations at the glenoid drive the overall patterns of movement in freshwater turtles,
  whereas glenohumeral LAR in loggerheads is used to direct the position and orientation
  of the elbow, which is the joint that determines the orientation of the thrust‐generating
  structure (the flipper) in loggerheads.'
