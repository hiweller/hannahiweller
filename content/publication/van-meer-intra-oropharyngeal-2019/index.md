abstract: "Despite the importance of intraoral food transport and swallowing, relatively
  few studies have examined the biomechanics of these behaviors in non-tetrapods,
  which lack a muscular tongue. Studies show that elasmobranch and teleost fishes
  generate water currents as a ‘hydrodynamic tongue’ that presumably transports food
  towards and into the esophagus. However, it remains largely unknown how specific
  musculoskeletal motions during transport correspond to food motion. Previous studies
  of white-spotted bamboo sharks (*Chiloscyllium plagiosum*) hypothesized that motions
  of the hyoid, branchial arches, and pectoral girdle, generate caudal motion of the
  food through the long oropharynx of modern sharks. To test these hypotheses, we
  measured food and cartilage motion with XROMM during intra-oropharyngeal transport
  and swallowing (n=3 individuals, 2-3 trials per individual). After entering the
  mouth, food does not move smoothly toward the esophagus, but rather moves in distinct
  steps with relatively little retrograde motion. Caudal food motion coincides with
  hyoid elevation and a closed mouth, supporting earlier studies showing that hyoid
  motion contributes to intra-oropharyngeal food transport by creating caudally-directed
  water currents. Little correspondence between pectoral girdle and food motion was
  found, indicating minimal contribution of pectoral girdle motion. Transport speed
  was fast as food entered the mouth, slower and step-wise through the pharyngeal
  region and then fast again as it entered the esophagus. The food's static periods
  in the step-wise motion and its high velocity during swallowing could not be explained
  by hyoid or girdle motion, suggesting these sharks may also use the branchial arches
  for intra-oropharyngeal transport and swallowing."
