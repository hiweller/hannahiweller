abstract: '*Pseudogymnoascus destructans* colonizes the wing membrane of hibernating
  bats with the potential to form dense fungal hyphae aggregates within cupping erosions.
  These fungal cupping erosions emit a characteristic fluorescent orange-yellow color
  when the wing membrane is transilluminated with 385 nm ultraviolet (UV) light. The
  purpose of this study was to create and validate the R package, countcolors, for
  quantifying the distinct orange–yellow UV fluorescence in batwing membrane lesions
  caused by *P. destructans*. Validation of countcolors was completed by first quantifying
  the percent area of 20, 2.5 cm2 images. These generated images were of two known
  pixel colors ranging from 0% to 100% of the pixels. The countcolors package accurately
  measured the known proportion of a given color in each image. Next, 40, 2.5 cm2
  sections of UV transilluminated photographs of little brown bat (*Myotis lucifugus*)
  wings were given to a single evaluator. The area of fluorescence was both manually
  measured and calculated using image analysis software and quantified with countcolors.
  There was good agreement between the two methods (Pearson’s correlation¼0.915);
  however, the manual use of imaging software showed a consistent negative bias. Reproducibility
  of the analysis methods was tested by providing the same images to naive evaluators
  who previously never used the software; no significant difference (P = 0.099) was
  found among evaluators. Using the R package countcolors takes less time than does
  manually measuring the fluorescence in image analysis software, and our results
  showed that countcolors can improve the accuracy when quantifying the area of P.
  destructans infection in bat wing-membranes.'
