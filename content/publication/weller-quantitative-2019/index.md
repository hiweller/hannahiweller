abstract: Biological color may be adaptive or incidental, seasonal or permanent, species-
  or population-speciﬁc, or modiﬁed for breeding, defense or camouﬂage. Although color
  is a hugely informative aspect of biology, quantitative color comparisons are notoriously
  difﬁcult. Color comparison is limited by categorization methods, with available
  tools requiring either subjective classiﬁcations, or expensive equipment, software,
  and expertise. We present an R package for processing images of organisms (or other
  objects) in order to quantify color proﬁles, gather color trait data, and compare
  color palettes on the basis of color similarity and amount. The package treats image
  pixels as 3D coordinates in a “color space,” producing a multidimensional color
  histogram for each image. Pairwise distances between histograms are computed using
  earth mover’s distance, a technique borrowed from computer vision, that compares
  histograms using transportation costs. Users choose a color space, parameters for
  generating color histograms, and a pairwise comparison method to produce a color
  distance matrix for a set of images. The package is intended as a more rigorous
  alternative to subjective, manual digital image analyses, not as a replacement for
  more advanced techniques that rely on detailed spectrophotometry methods unavailable
  to many users. Here, we outline the basic functions of colordistance, provide guidelines
  for the available color spaces and quantiﬁcation methods, and compare this toolkit
  with other available methods.
