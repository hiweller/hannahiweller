abstract: Colour pattern variation provides biological information in fields ranging
  from disease ecology to speciation dynamics. Comparing colour pattern geometries
  across images requires colour segmentation, where pixels in an image are assigned
  to one of a set of colour classes shared by all images. Manual methods for colour
  segmentation are slow and subjective, while automated methods can struggle with
  high technical variation in aggregate image sets. We present recolorize, an R package
  toolbox for human-­subjective colour segmentation with functions for batch-­processing
  low-­variation image sets and additional tools for handling images from diverse
  (high-­variation) sources. The package also includes export options for a variety
  of formats and colour analysis packages. This paper illustrates recolorize for three
  example datasets, including high variation, batch processing and combining with
  reflectance spectra, and demonstrates the downstream use of methods that rely on
  this output.
