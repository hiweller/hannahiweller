abstract: 'Multifunctionality is often framed as a core constraint of evolution, yet
  many evolutionary transitions involve traits taking on additional functions. Mouthbrooding,
  a form of parental care where offspring develop inside a parent’s mouth, increases
  multifunctionality by adding a major function (reproduction) to a structure already
  serving other vital functions (feeding and respiration). Despite increasing multifunctionality,
  mouthbrooding has evolved repeatedly from other forms of parental care in at least
  seven ﬁsh families. We hypothesized that mouthbrooding is more likely to evolve
  in lineages with feeding adaptations that are already advantageous for mouthbrooding.
  We tested this hypothesis in Neotropical cichlids, where mouthbrooding has evolved
  four or ﬁve times, largely within winnowing clades, providing several pairwise comparisons
  between substrate-brooding and mouthbrooding sister taxa. We found that the mouthbrooding
  transition rate was 15 times higher in winnowing than in nonwinnowing clades and
  that mouthbrooders and winnowers overlapped substantially in their buccal cavity
  morphologies, which is where offspring are incubated. Species that exhibit one or
  both of these behaviors had larger, more curved buccal cavities, while species that
  exhibit neither behavior had narrow, cylindrical buccal cavities. Given the results
  we present here, we propose a new conceptual model for the evolution of mouthbrooding,
  integrating the roles of multifunctional morphology and the environment. We suggest
  that functional transitions like mouthbrooding offer a different perspective on
  multifunctionality: increasing constraints in one trait may release them for another,
  generating new evolutionary opportunities.'
