abstract: Most predatory ray-finned fishes swallow their food whole, which
  can pose a significant challenge, given that prey items can be half as large as
  the predators themselves. How do fish transport captured food from the mouth to
  the stomach? Prior work indicates that, in general, fish use the pharyngeal jaws
  to manipulate food into the esophagus, where peristalsis is thought to take over.
  We used X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology to track prey transport in channel
  catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*). By reconstructing the 3D motions of both the food
  and the catfish, we were able to track how the catfish move food through the head
  and into the stomach. Food enters the oral cavity at high velocities as a continuation
  of suction and stops in the approximate location of the branchial basket before
  moving in a much slower, more complex path toward the esophagus. This slow phase
  coincides with little motion in the head and no substantial mouth opening or hyoid
  depression. Once the prey is in the esophagus, however, its transport is surprisingly
  tightly correlated with gulping motions (hyoid depression, girdle retraction, hypaxial
  shortening, and mouth opening) of the head. Although the transport mechanism itself
  remains unknown, to our knowledge, this is the first description of synchrony between
  cranial expansion and esophageal transport in a fish. Our results provide direct
  evidence of prey transport within the esophagus and suggest that peristalsis may
  not be the sole mechanism of esophageal transport in catfish.
